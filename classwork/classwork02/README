The specifications are as follows:

Write a program called evenOddTable.cto vary the value of an integer variable i from -10 to +10 and output a simple table.
For each value, print i as well as the value of i times i.
Also print out whether i is even or odd by displaying the word EVEN or ODD at the end of each line.
Separate the output into columns to make a table using the tab character \t.
Count the number of EVEN and ODD values, and display the counts at the end of the table after a blank line.
Try to make all the output columns line up neatly. You can decide whether they are left- or right- justified. Left is easier, but right looks nicer for the numbers.
HINT: remember that integer division TRUNCATES, so that 5/3 gives 1 but 5.0/3 or 5/3.0 gives the value 1.666667.
Your program should produce output similar to the following [but without the fancy HTML stuff; you can simply output the values in columns, don't try to make an HTML table out of it unless you want some extra challenge]:

-10	100	EVEN
-9	81	ODD
-8	64	EVEN
…	…	…
+8	64	EVEN
+9	81	ODD
+10	100	EVEN

# odd numbers = 10
# even numbers = 11
