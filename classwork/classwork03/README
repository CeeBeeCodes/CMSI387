For the exercise, write a program called goFish.cthat sums and averages a list of numbers, then creates a string and produces a count. You must use EITHER an array, or a set of pointers as the data storage. The program's specifications are as follows:

The numbers must be prompted for in a loop
The special value -9999 is used to indicate that the entries are complete
Store the values in a structure of some kind that is initially declared to be size 25 int elements
Loop through the structure and sum the elements, then output the sum to the console
Count the number of elements in the structure, and output their average to the console
Loop through the structure again, and contatenate all the values into a long string
Output the string to the console
Loop through the string, and count all the 7 [seven] characters; this is like in the game Go Fish when you ask another player, GIMME ALL YOUR SEVENS.
Output the count to the console
